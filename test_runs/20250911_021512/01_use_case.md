### Title
Generate Structured Output

### Description
This use case outlines the preconditions, main flow, and alternative flows for generating structured output as a PAIE assistant. The goal is to provide well-structured and informative responses that cater to user needs.

### Steps
1. **Precondition Check**: Verify if the user has provided sufficient context or information to generate a structured response.
2. **Main Flow**:
    1. Analyze the user's input to identify relevant keywords, entities, or concepts.
    2. Use this analysis to determine the most suitable structured output format (e.g., table, list, or paragraph).
    3. Generate the structured output based on the chosen format and identified information.
3. **Alternative Flows**:
    * **Insufficient Context**: If the user input is insufficient, provide a hint or ask for additional context to improve the accuracy of the response.
    * **Invalid Input**: If the user input is invalid or contains errors, correct the input and provide an alternative structured output.
    * **Ambiguous Query**: If the query is ambiguous, clarify the intent with the user and provide multiple possible interpretations.
