The Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Integration module aims to enhance the security of our system by requiring users to provide an additional form of verification in addition to their password. This will ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The 2FA integration is successfully implemented and enabled for all user accounts.
- Users are prompted to enter a verification code sent via SMS or authenticator app after entering their password.
- The system verifies the user's identity using the provided code before granting access.

- The system logs all successful and failed login attempts, including 2FA verification results.
