### Title:

Creating a User Story for Model Selector

### Description:

As a user, I want to be able to select and switch between different local Large Language Models (LLMs) without having to restart the application or rely on external resources. This will enable me to personalize my experience with each LLM, leveraging its unique strengths and addressing specific use cases.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The Model Selector feature allows users to browse through a list of available local LLMs.
- Users can select an LLM from the list and see its name, description, and performance metrics displayed prominently.
- When a user selects an LLM, the application switches to that model's context, allowing for seamless interaction without interruption.
- The Model Selector feature is accessible from any screen or interface within the application.
- The application provides clear instructions on how to use the Model Selector feature, including tutorials or guides if necessary.
