Description:

Steps:

1. **View Analytics with Data**: When the database (DB) contains data, provide a view analytics section that displays relevant metrics and insights. This could include charts, graphs, or tables to help users understand their performance over time.
2. **View Analytics without Data**: When the DB is empty, display a message indicating that no data is available for viewing analytics. This could be a simple notification or a link to a data import process.

Note: The exact implementation details will depend on the specific requirements and functionality of your application.
