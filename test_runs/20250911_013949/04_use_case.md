### Title
Switch Model via Dropdown with Validation and Fallback

### Description
This guide outlines the implementation of a switch model using a dropdown interface, incorporating validation and fallback mechanisms to ensure seamless user experience.

### Steps
1. **Implement Dropdown Interface**: Create a dropdown menu that allows users to select from predefined options.
2. **Add Validation Mechanism**: Integrate a validation system to check if the selected option is valid or not.
3. **Configure Fallback Options**: Set up fallback options in case the primary selection fails or is invalid.
4. **Test and Refine**: Thoroughly test the implementation, gathering feedback from users and refining the interface as needed.
