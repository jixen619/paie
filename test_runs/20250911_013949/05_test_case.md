### Title
Creating Test Cases for SQLite Logging

### Description
This guide outlines the steps to create comprehensive test cases for SQLite logging in our offline AI assistant. The primary focus is on ensuring that row writes are successful, timestamps are valid, and charts render correctly.

### Steps
1. **Test Case 1: Row Write Success**
    *   Verify that a new row can be successfully written to the SQLite database.
    *   Check if the timestamp associated with the row write is accurate.
2. **Test Case 2: Timestamp Validation**
    *   Test that an invalid or missing timestamp results in an error.
    *   Validate that a valid timestamp is correctly stored and retrieved.
3. **Test Case 3: Chart Rendering**
    *   Ensure that charts render correctly after writing data to the SQLite database.
    *   Verify that chart rendering is not affected by row writes or timestamps.
