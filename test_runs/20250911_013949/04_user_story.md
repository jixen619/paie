### Title:

Generating User Story for Chat History Grouped by Date with Per-Item Downloads

### Description:

As a PAIE, I will create a user story that outlines the functionality of displaying chat history grouped by date with per-item downloads. This feature will allow users to efficiently review and manage their past conversations.

### Acceptance Criteria:

* The system displays chat history in chronological order, grouped by date.
* Each conversation is displayed as a separate item, including relevant details such as timestamp, user IDs, and content.
* Users can download individual items or batches of items for further analysis or reference.
