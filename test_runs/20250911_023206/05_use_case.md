View Analytics

### Description
This guide explains how to view analytics in a database, both when there is data available and when the database is empty. The purpose of this feature is to provide insights into user behavior and optimize future interactions.

### Steps
1. **Accessing View Analytics**: To access view analytics, navigate to the 'Analytics' section within your database.
2. **Viewing Data**: Once in the analytics section, you will see a graph displaying user activity over time. This graph can be zoomed in or out for better visualization.
3. **Analyzing Empty Database**: If the database is empty, there will be no data displayed on the graph. In this case, consider reaching out to your support team for assistance with populating the database.

4. **Viewing Data When Available**: If the database contains data, you can view detailed analytics such as user demographics and interaction patterns.
5. **Interpreting Analytics**: Take time to analyze the provided insights, focusing on trends and areas of improvement for future development.

6. **Customizing Analytics**: Depending on your specific needs, some databases may offer additional customization options for viewing analytics. Explore these features if available to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior.
7. **Exporting Data**: Some databases allow you to export data in various formats (e.g., CSV) for further analysis or integration with other tools.

8. **Regular Updates**: Regularly check for updates to the view analytics feature, as new insights and features may be added over time.
