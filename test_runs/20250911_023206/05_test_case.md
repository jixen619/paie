### Title
Creating Test Cases for SQLite Logging in PAIE

### Description
This guide outlines the steps to create comprehensive test cases for SQLite logging in PAIE. The goal is to ensure that row writes are successful, timestamps are accurate, and charts render correctly.

### Steps
1. **Test Case 1: Row Write**
   - Test that a new row can be written successfully to the SQLite database.
   - Verify that the row contains all required fields (e.g., user ID, timestamp).
2. **Test Case 2: Timestamp Validation**
   - Test that timestamps are validated correctly when writing rows to the database.
   - Ensure that invalid or missing timestamps result in an error message.
3. **Test Case 3: Chart Rendering**
   - Test that charts render correctly after writing rows to the SQLite database.
   - Verify that chart data is accurate and up-to-date.

Note: These test cases should be run with a controlled environment, such as a test database or a sandboxed PAIE instance, to ensure accurate results.
