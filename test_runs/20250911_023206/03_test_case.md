### Title:

Creating Test Cases for BI Export

### Description:

This guide outlines the creation of test cases for Business Intelligence (BI) export scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability. The test cases cover various error conditions, including file existence, schema correctness, permission errors, and handling large datasets.

### Steps:

1. **File Existence**: Verify that files exist and can be exported successfully.
2. **Schema Correctness**: Test the BI export with a correct schema to ensure data integrity.
3. **Permission Error**: Simulate a permission error by attempting to export data without necessary permissions.
4. **Large Data**: Test the BI export with large datasets to evaluate performance and handling capabilities.

Note: These test cases should be executed in a controlled environment to prevent data loss or corruption.
