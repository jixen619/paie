### Title

Generate Structured Output

### Description

This use case outlines the preconditions, main flow, and alternative flows for generating structured output as a PAIE assistant. The primary goal is to provide users with well-structured and organized responses that meet their specific needs.

### Steps

1. **Precondition Check**: Verify user input is valid and relevant.
2. **Determine Output Structure**: Based on user preferences and context, decide on the most suitable output structure (e.g., list, table, paragraph).
3. **Generate Content**: Use knowledge graph and language models to generate content for the chosen output structure.
4. **Format and Style**: Apply formatting and styling rules to ensure consistency and readability.
5. **Post-processing**: Perform any necessary post-processing tasks, such as spell-checking or grammar correction.

### Alt Flows

*   **Invalid Input**: If user input is invalid or cannot be processed, provide an error message with suggestions for improvement.
*   **Insufficient Context**: If context is insufficient to generate accurate output, request additional information from the user.
*   **User Preferences Conflict**: If user preferences conflict with each other (e.g., format vs. content), prompt the user to resolve the conflict.
