### Title
Manage History (View, Search, Download, Clear)

### Description
The Manage History feature allows users to view, search, download, and clear their personal data history. This feature is designed to provide users with control over their data and ensure that it is handled in a secure and transparent manner.

### Steps

1. **Viewing Personal Data History**
   - The user initiates the "Manage History" action.
   - PAIE displays a list of all previously accessed data, including but not limited to, conversations, search queries, and other relevant information.

2. **Searching for Specific Data**
   - The user searches for specific data within their history using keywords or phrases.
   - PAIE returns a list of matching results, which can be further filtered or sorted as needed.

3. **Downloading Personal Data History**
   - The user selects the option to download their entire personal data history.
   - PAIE securely exports the requested data in a format compatible with standard data storage and analysis tools.

4. **Clearing Personal Data History**
   - The user initiates the "Clear" action for their personal data history.
   - PAIE securely deletes all previously accessed data, ensuring that it is completely removed from its systems.

### Exceptions
- **Sensitive Information**: In cases where sensitive information (e.g., financial data, health records) is involved, additional measures may be taken to protect the user's privacy. This could include encrypted storage or secure deletion methods.
- **Legal Requirements**: PAIE must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding data retention and access. This may involve storing certain data for extended periods or providing access in response to legal requests.
- **System Maintenance**: During scheduled system maintenance, PAIE may temporarily restrict access to the Manage History feature as a precautionary measure. Users will be notified of any planned downtime and provided with alternative methods for accessing their data during this time.
