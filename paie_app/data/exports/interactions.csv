    - Expected outcome: System prompts user to re-register or update their 2FA code.
3. **Wrong 2FA Code**:
    - Test case: Login attempt with an incorrect 2FA code.
    - Preconditions: User has registered for 2FA, correct code is known.
    - Expected outcome: System displays error message and prompts user to re-enter the code.
4. **Rate Limiting**:
    - Test case: Multiple login attempts within a short timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes).
    - Preconditions: User has registered for 2FA, multiple login attempts are made within the rate limit window.
    - Expected outcome: System displays error message indicating rate limit exceeded and prompts user to wait before attempting again.","test_case","default","41812",,,"2025-09-11T01:37:32.078199"\n"60","1","Create test cases for Model Selector (default loads, switch, missing model, fallback)","Title:

Creating Test Cases for BI Export

### Description:

This guide outlines the creation of test cases for Business Intelligence (BI) export scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability. The test cases cover various error conditions, including file existence, schema correctness, permission errors, and handling large datasets.

### Steps:

1. **File Existence**: Verify that files exist and can be exported successfully.
2. **Schema Correctness**: Test the BI export with a correct schema to ensure data integrity.
3. **Permission Error**: Simulate a permission error by attempting to export data without necessary permissions.
4. **Large Data**: Test the BI export with large datasets to evaluate performance and handling capabilities.

Note: These test cases should be executed in a controlled environment to prevent data loss or corruption.","test_case","default","21615",,,"2025-09-11T01:38:00.494501"\n"62","1","Create test cases for History (search works, MD/JSON/DOCX downloads, clear history)","### Title:

Creating Test Cases for SQLite Logging in PAIE

### Description
This guide outlines the steps to create comprehensive test cases for SQLite logging in PAIE. The goal is to ensure that row writes are successful, timestamps are accurate, and charts render correctly.

### Steps
1. **Test Case 1: Row Write**
   - Test that a new row can be written successfully to the SQLite database.
   - Verify that the row contains all required fields (e.g., user ID, timestamp).
2. **Test Case 2: Timestamp Validation**
   - Test that timestamps are validated correctly when writing rows to the database.
   - Ensure that invalid or missing timestamps result in an error message.
3. **Test Case 3: Chart Rendering**
   - Test that charts render correctly after writing rows to the SQLite database.
   - Verify that chart data is accurate and up-to-date.

Note: These test cases should be run with a controlled environment, such as a test database or a sandboxed PAIE instance, to ensure accurate results.","test_case","default","28949",,,"2025-09-11T01:38:48.847534"\n"64","1","Summarize PAIE goals and deliverables for a project brief with risks and assumptions","### Topic:
